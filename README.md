# I_LOVE_IKEA_SHINY_APP

This is [the Ikea hackaton](http://hackathon.ikea.com/) R Shiny app that we (I, Jos van Dongen and Thomas van Dongen) created on December 7,8,9 of 2017. The instructions for the app are quite simple, see images below.


The app helps IKEA customers to look for Ikea products by means of image search. Take a picture, upload it and you will get the top natching IKEA products back.
